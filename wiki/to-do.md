# Wiki content
* Placeholder for many things
# Wiki engine
* Better sorting of menu items and a function to pin items to top. Currently items are sorted by their names. Items beginning with a capital letter are shown on top, so `Z` goes before `a`. Kinda weird.
* HTML title is `IOTA Wiki` everywhere. Really bad. It should contain the title of the current page too. Users should be able to define metatags on their pages.
