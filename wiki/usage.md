# Registration
After registration users have to wait for a moderator to create their user section `/u/username` and grant them write permission. Once your username is listed in the `All pages â†’ Users` menu and [user list](/u) you are ready to go.

# Uploads & Images
Uploads are currently not well supported and handled by the wiki engine. The permission system is not available, so the functions to delete and move files will have to be disabled until a better solution is implemented.
* Files and images should be uploaded to a folder similar to the path of their usage. Files appearing in `wallet/guide` page should be uploaded to `wallet` or `wallet-guide` folder. The slash `/` character cannot be used and will be turned into a hyphen `-`.
* Users should create their own upload folder `u-username` for files and images they want to use within their `/u/username` section. Subfolders are not supported yet (for uploads).
* The maximum upload file size is limited to 5 MB for images and 50 MB for other files. Please contact a [moderator](/wiki/moderator) if you need to upload larger files. Files and images can only be moved and deleted by moderators.
# Delete content
* It is currently not possible to delete pages via the interface. Pages either have to be renamed and used for a different purpose or be deleted manually by [moderators](/wiki/moderators).
